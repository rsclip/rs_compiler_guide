# Semantic Analysis

Semantic Analysis is a stage in the compilation process where the compiler checks the program for semantic errors; they're errors that occur when the program is syntactically correct but the meaning of the program is incorrect. For example, if you try to add a number to a string, the parser will not catch this error during parsing because the syntax is correct. However, the program will not run correctly because you cannot add a number to a string.

This code will be contained in the module `src/semantic_analysis`, so be sure to create that directory and add a file `mod.rs` to it.

> **Note**
>
>  Before implementing, it's advisable to adjust your error module to accept **warnings** too, since we will be analyzing the code for both errors and warnings.

> We will not cover it here.

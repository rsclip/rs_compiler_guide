# Parsing and Syntax Analysis
Now that we have a stream of tokens, we can start to analyze the syntax of the program. This is the process of parsing the tokens to determine the structure of the program. The result of this process is an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is a tree representation of the program's structure.

This chapter will cover the following topics:
- ASTs and their uses
- How grammars work, and how to use them
- Parsing techniques
- How to implement a parser
